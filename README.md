# Hi there, I'm Hins! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
- I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Zhejiang University (ZJU), China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³. My primary focus is on developing innovative projects in the fields of cryptography and blockchain applications. I firmly believe in the potential of cryptocurrency and distributed technologies, and I am deeply enthusiastic about contributing to their growth and advancement.
- In addition, I am proficient in full-stack development. As an example, I was a co-founder of [MatchUs](https://github.com/MatchUs-ZJU), a WeChat mini-program designed to help university students connect and make friends online. This platform has successfully served over 100,000 students. More information can be found on Redbook ðŸ“•.
